# causal_impact

For this project, we shall work with breast cancer diagnosis data. Using machine learning algorithms, scientists are
able to predict the patient's health conditions using characteristics of individual cells obtained from a minimally
invasive needle aspirate. Using this information about cells, a breast lump can be classified as benign or malignant.

This project combine data exploration followed by feature extraction before it continues with causal inference

- Perform a causal inference task using Pearlâ€™s framework
- Infer the causal graph from observational data and then validate the graph;
- Merge machine learning with causal inference;
